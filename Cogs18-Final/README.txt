Data Analysis on Randomness in Human Choices

Name: Dhruv Sood  
PID: A18321957  

Project Overview:  
This project investigates the randomness of human choices using a simulated dataset of "random guesses." The goal was to analyze patterns, biases, and deviations from true randomness. By combining concepts from the course, including modular programming, data analysis, and visualization, with new ideas like clustering and statistical testing, I explored how humans deviate from random behavior.

Project Structure:  
The project is organized as follows:  
- ProjectNotebook.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the project.  
- data/: Contains datasets.  
  - random_guess.csv: The simulated dataset.  
- my_module/: Custom Python modules.  
  - data_processing.py: Functions for dataset generation and loading.  
  - analysis.py: Functions for randomness metrics and clustering.  
  - visualization.py: Functions for data visualization.  
  - testing.py: Functions for statistical tests like Chi-Square.  
- tests/: Test cases for validating functions.  
  - test_analysis.py: Tests for the analysis module.  
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the project.

How to Run the Project:  
1. Set up the environment:  
   Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:  

2. Run the notebook:  
Open `ProjectNotebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells sequentially to see the dataset generation, analysis, and visualization.  

3. Run the tests:  
Navigate to the `tests/` folder in the terminal and run:
